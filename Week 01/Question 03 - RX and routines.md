# Tutorial 1 - ENEX20001: Deeper Dive into AVR Programming

## Welcome to the Next Steps in Microcontroller Programming!

After getting familiar with the basics of USART communication, we'll now tackle some more practical examples that will help you understand how to work with different data types and control the flow of your programs.

## Question 2: Handling Floating-Point Numbers

### The Challenge

You might find that trying to print floating-point numbers (like 3.14) directly with `sprintf` using `%f` doesn't work as expected in Tinkercad or other AVR environments. That's because `sprintf` doesn't support floating-point formatting by default, to save space. Instead, we use a special function called `dtostrf` to turn the floating-point number into a string first.

### Pseudocode

Here's our plan:

1. Start USART communication.
2. Continuously:
   - Format an integer to a string and send it.
   - Try to format a float directly to a string (it won't work).
   - Convert a float to a string using `dtostrf`.
   - Send the formatted float string.
   - Wait for 5 seconds.

### Your Task

Modify the `main` function in the template code provided. Use `dtostrf` to handle floating-point numbers.

### Code Overview

Your code will look something like this:

```c
// ... [rest of the setup code]

int main(void) {
  // Initialize USART
  // ... [your code here]
}
```

## Question 3: Multiplying Numbers via USART

### The Objective

Now we'll receive numbers from the user, multiply them, and send back the result. This will be your introduction to receiving data (RX) as well as sending it (TX).

### Pseudocode

Here's what we'll do:

1. Start USART communication.
2. Ask the user for two numbers.
3. Read the numbers from USART.
4. Multiply them using a special function.
5. Send back the result.
6. Wait a bit and repeat.

### Your Task

Add a multiplication function to your code and update the `main` function to use it.

### Code Snippet

Here's the additional function and the updated `main` function:

```c
int multiply(int a, int b); // Multiply two numbers

int main(void) {
  // Initialize USART and perform the tasks
}
```

## Question 4: Even or Odd and Factorial

### What We're Doing

We'll read a number from the user and tell them if it's even or odd. Then, we'll calculate the factorial of that number.

### Pseudocode

Follow these steps:

1. Set up USART communication.
2. Continuously:
   - Get a number from USART.
   - Check if it's even or odd, and tell the user.
   - Calculate the factorial of the number.
   - Send the result.
   - Pause for 5 seconds.

### Your Task

Work on the logic inside the `while` loop of the `main` function to perform the even/odd check and factorial calculation.

### Code Structure

Your `main` function will look something like this:

```c
int main(void) {
  // Initialize USART
  // ... [rest of your code]
}
```

## Conclusion

As you work through these examples, remember that programming is about solving problems step by step. Don't hesitate to ask questions if something isn't clearâ€”we're here to help you learn. Keep experimenting, and enjoy the process of creating programs that can interact with the world!

Happy coding!
